This project was part of CSC367 - Parallel Programming. It was done during my 3rd year of undergrad at UofT. 

The final mark was high 80 to low 90 (I only remember it was not perfect but quite high).

The reason for the imperfect mark was due to the performance of one of the filters not producing the correct output with images of certain dimensions (I believe with very large images).
