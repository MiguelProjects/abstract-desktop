The games directory is the final iteration of this project. Games00 to games09 are steps to the final process. 
MVC principles are utilized in this project. Index.php is the controller and the model and view are sorted as needed.

The files 'guessGame2MVC' and 'rockPaperScissors' are the initial forms of the pages added into games.

In each gamesX folder there is  a setup.sh folder in /dev. This set up a table in our data base so insertions and queries can be made properly.
