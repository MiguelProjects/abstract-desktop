Work done with E-health access on Medunova was done as a team following the agile methodology. As such, sprints and development practices such as CRC cards were used.

Please note, this is not all the files that were finished (or even worked on) during the time with E-health access. Github was not utilized, instead using the company's own servers and wordpress. These are the files that could be recovered from early development.

The power point was used as a presentation to the client and other invovled groups.

Some files have been removed/altered to protect their identity or information. Namely the names and ID/credentials of the group members
