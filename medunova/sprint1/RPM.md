# Sprint Goal
The goal for this sprint was to learn and research the technologies (HTML, PHP and SQL) we plan to use on the rest of the project. It was also to finalise our architecture decisions and get an overview for our project's structure.

# Release Goal
Our goal for this project is to design and implement a search bar for medical patients to ask questions about their medication and receive answers in a chatbot-like format. If our software cannot find an answer we return a generic "Please ask your pharmacist" message.

Some user stories involved are:
  - Designing the search and chatbot UI
  - Setting up a database structure to store and retrieve medication monographs
  - Breaking down user queries into useful keywords for searching.
  - Developing an algorithm to parse medication monographs
  - Developing an algorithm to search for answers based on keywords
  - Linking the tiers of our architecture together
