Meeting held on Sunday January 31st 2021. Decided to dedicate time to research for future development, also awaiting access
to beta website from client (Mina Gobrail). Also, decided on the velocity but does not apply for this week as we will do as much research as possible.
Also decided that weekly meetings with our client should be set up on Mondays. For this the client requested Slack should be set up for
communications so the Slack server was set up a trial of the software and invited everyone.

Research the programs needed to satisfy the requirements of the search bar. This sprint is mostly a spike so we only
focus on research instead of development as we are unaware of all the programs/languages we should be using to incorporate the
search bar.
