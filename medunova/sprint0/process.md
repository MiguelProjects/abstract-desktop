How did you organize the team?  Which tools did you use, if any?
- We organized ourselves using mainly discord. In our group's discord server we initially sent messages at the start of the week asking when/if people were available for a quick meeting sometime in the week. 
There we decided who would receive which stories.

How did you make decisions?
- On Wednesday we all met up in a discord voice call and discussed what we needed to do that week and if there were any developments that needed to be addressed. 
During this call we had one person throw out ideas for what he thought the ratings for stories should be and everyone chimed in on whether or not they agreed.

How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?  How many rounds of voting (on average)did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
- We defined the points based primarily on how long a story would take to fully complete. Difficulty of a story is also a deciding factor but we saw time as a more 
valuable resource, particularly because we could get to a functioning state with little issue but getting to a perfect state would require lots of testing to perfect certain algorithms/features. 
This week we only required one round to reach a consensus.

How frequently did you meet?
- We met once in the week, in the middle of the week, for a voice meeting. However, we kept in constant communication with each other through discord.

What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
- We should allocate time for our meetings earlier in the week
- We should be more critical of the ratings of future user stories, as time management will be important as user stories get more complex
- We should get communicate readily but not too much, i.e become accustomed to interacting as a team
