As a User, I want the wordpress website operational and without
bugs in order to test the other functionalities of the website

  the client as to start implementing new features

Notes:
For U.S 1.02 - 1.03 may need to break down into smaller stories
and develop a 'mock' website with a signle PDF and search bar to
start the implementations as we may not have access to the beta
website developed by our client
