Summary:
Project Objectives:
Create a search engine capable of searching through a medicine monograph paper, and returning the desired information pertaining to that medicine. The search engine should be able to receive questions written casually (E.g. Can I have my medicine with food?). Furthermore, upon returning the information requested, it should prompt the user to put in any follow up requests (with some possible recommendations of its own). If the search engine could not find any appropriate information, it will instead prompt the user to call their nearest pharmacy.

Key Users:
Patients – These will be people who were prescribed medication and have questions about said medication. Due to the lack of ease of access to pharmacists, our product will serve as an easy method of getting answers to most of their medication-related questions.  
Doctors – These will be the people ensuring that the right information is listed in the monograph papers for the relevant medications

Key Usage Scenarios:
Patients are at home and do not have immediate access to a Pharmacist, yet they have an immediate question relating to their medicine. They can use the website to quickly search up an answer for their question (e.g. they can ask “Can I have food with Medicine X”, and the search engine will give them the answer).

Key Principles:
-	Our search engine must ensure that the information returned, relating to the question about the medication is both accurate and relevant. If the accuracy of the information returned is though to be compromised, then the search engine will instead prompt the user to call the nearest pharmacy.
-	Accuracy is prioritised over speed. If there is a search algorithm is faster, but has a lower accuracy rate, the slower more accurate algorithm will be prioritised. 
-	The monograph papers that are used by the search engine will only store up-to-date correct information and cannot be altered in any way.
