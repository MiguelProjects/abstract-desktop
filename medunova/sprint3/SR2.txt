Sprint 2 Retrospect

Attendence: REDACTED

Good practices:
-Planned out what had to be done in comparison to last sprint and the use Jira was better, although weas a bit delayed next week should
be done faster and update Jira more frequently
-Regular meetings and communication with group members and product owner/staff via Slack

Bad practices:
-Took too long to start sprint, we had ideas earlier but the sprint was started mid-week instead of start, must prioritize backlog more
-Need to be more descriptive on our posts on Jira, the TA's found it hard to track what we were doing and how we approached the story must make it
clear how we approach the story and its purpose.
-Need to follow the CRC cards more and closely connect our code to them, our team is currently programming different functions but when
we connect them we need to know what our design is

Next Week:
-Have better timing with the sprint start and uploading to product backlog using Jira
-Have CRC meeting to have a overall better design
-Any user stories finished we can hold a quick meeting to show and test
